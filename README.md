# MongoDB Nested Field Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with nested documents in MongoDB using Node.js.  The `bug.js` file shows incorrect handling of nested fields within a MongoDB query. This approach can result in unexpected errors or incorrect data retrieval, especially if the nested fields are not always present.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected approach using proper dot notation for accessing nested fields, improving robustness and handling potential errors effectively.
